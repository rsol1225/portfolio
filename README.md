# Portfolio Website

A single-page portfolio with About, social links, Experience, Projects, Leadership, and Volunteering.

## Quick start

Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a local server:

```bash
cd portfolio
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000

## Customize

1. **Photo** – Replace the `src` in the about section with your image path (e.g. `photo.jpg` in the same folder).
2. **Name & bio** – Edit the "Your Name" and the paragraph in the About section.
3. **Social links** – Update the `href` values for:
   - LinkedIn: `https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`
   - GitHub: `https://github.com/yourusername`
   - Medium: `https://medium.com/@yourusername`
4. **Experience, Projects, Leadership, Volunteering** – Replace the placeholder card content with your own roles and descriptions.

All content is in `index.html`; styling is in `styles.css`.
